## Fixing Open in IINA

IINA has a bundled version of `youtube-dl`, that's probably out of date. Use a more up-to-date version from Homebrew by setting `/usr/local/bin/` (note that's just the directory not the full path to `youtube-dl`) as the `Custom youtube-dl path` under `Preferences > Network`. (You might need to update `youtube-dl` itself as well.)
