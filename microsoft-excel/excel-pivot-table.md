# Excel Pivot Table

- To add newly added fields to the Pivot Table, right-click and select "Refresh".
- A pivot table is for summarizing data.
- To get around the "Pivot Table field name already exists" error when renaming a column to the same name as a column in an existing table, the convention is to add a space to the end of the column name.
