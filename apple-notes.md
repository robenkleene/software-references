# Apple Notes

- Double-click on a note to float it (or select "Float Selected Note") from the menu
- `⇧⌘U`: Toggle checkbox
- Click and hold a list item to re-order it

## Troubleshooting

If the quick note corner shortcut isn't working on macOS, try toggling on iCloud syncing for the On My Mac notes location.
