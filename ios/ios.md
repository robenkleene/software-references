# iOS

## Settings

- If `Voice Control` keeps getting turned on on iPhone, disable `Settings > Accessibility > Accessibility Shortcut`

## Miscellaneous

- To export a PDF, from the print menu, pinch to expand a thumbnail preview, from the zoomed in thumbnail preview, there's a share icon

## Lock Screen

- Swipe left on the lock screen to enter the camera

## Springboard

### Multi-Tasking

- To remove an app in Slide over, swipe up from the bottom of that app, then swipe the app up, just like the iPhone X app switcher

### Widgets

- To swipe a Widget Stack, the Widget Stack needs to expand slightly to illustrate that it's hovered (this seems inconsistent which is why Widget Stacks can be difficult to swipe).
