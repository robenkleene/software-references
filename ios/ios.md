# iOS

- To remove an app in Slide over, swipe up from the bottom of that app, then swipe the app up, just like the iPhone X app switcher
- To export a PDF, from the print menu, pinch to expand a thumbnail preview, from the zoomed in thumbnail preview, there's a share icon

### Widgets

- To swipe a Widget Stack, the Widget Stack needs to expand slightly to illustrate that it's hovered (this seems inconsistent which is why Widget Stacks can be difficult to swipe).
