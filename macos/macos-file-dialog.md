# macOS Save Dialog

- `⌃⇥`: Toggle focus between save filename to directory browser
- `⇧⌘N`: Create a folder
- `⌘↑`: Go to parent folder
- Just like in Finder windows, typing the first letters of a match in the current folder will jump to that match, this is often faster than searching

## Common Folders

- `⇧⌘H`: Go Home
- `⇧⌘D`: Go Desktop
- `⌥⌘L`: Go Downloads
- `⇧⌘O`: Go Documents
