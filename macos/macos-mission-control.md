# Mission Control

## Settings

- Disable `Desktop & Dock > When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application`, this allows switching to the application then opening a window in this space. Note that *even if this options is turned off, clicking the Dock icon when the application is active will still switch to another Space with windows for this application*.

## Troubleshooting

- Try `killall Dock` if you're having problems, e.g., new Spaces being created with a black background (even if it's persisting between restarts)
