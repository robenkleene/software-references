# Finder

- `⌥↑` / `⌥↓`: Move to the top / bottom of a directory listing
- `⌥⌘C`: Copy path to the selected file (or the open folder, if no file is selected), the path is already quoted for pasting into a terminal for example
- `⇧⌘G`: Enter path
- `⌘C`: Copy a file, it can then be pasted with `⌘V` (there's not such thing as "cut" for files, probably because two cuts before pasting would delete the first cut file)
- `⇧⌘.`: Toggle show hidden files
- Right-click and choose `Rename...` to rename (or add text) to multiple files with a find-and-replace-style interface

## Path Bar

- To run Services on the current selected Finder folder, toggle on `View > Show Path Bar` (the `Path Bar` also includes a right-click option to open a Terminal window at a folder)
- The `Path Bar` also provides a nice solution for opening the enclosing folder, right-click it in the path bar and choose `Open in New Window`

## Notes

- The Finder can only show the image dimensions for directories that are indexed by Spotlight. (Adobe Bridge is a good substitute.)
- To move a file, just drag to the filename or icon, you can't drag to the row if you're not also over the filename or icon.

## Batch Renaming

Just select `File > Rename X Items...` with multiple items selected.

## Spring-Loaded Folders

The problem with spring-loaded folders is that if the delay is too short, it conflicts with dragging a file onto an app icon in the dock to open it, and if it's too long it is too slow to use.

## Save Dialog Windows

1. Open a Finder window at the destination location.
2. Use the keyboard shortcut `⌥⌘C` to copy the path.
3. Go to the save dialog.
3. Use the keyboard shortcut `⇧⌘G` to enter the path.
