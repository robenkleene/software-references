# Fantastical vs. Calendar

- Fantastical has great NLP even input
- Fantastical supports todos, and works more reliably than Reminders
- Fantastical supports categorizing events to make events differentiated by color in a single calendar
- Fantastical has a nice outline view that shows events chronologically beyond a single day
