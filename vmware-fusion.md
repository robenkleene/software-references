# VMWare Fusion

- Shared folders are under settings for the Virtual Machine (`âŒ˜E` to open the current virtual machine's settings). Convention is to put the shared folder next to the Virtual Machine file itself.
- Shared folders are slow when working with lots of small files, so it's a good idea to `zip` folders with lots of files before transferring them over.
