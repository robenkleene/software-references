## CSS

- When a numerical CSS value is selected in the `Styles` tab, you can increment and decrement it by scrolling (two-finger dragging) up and down.

## Tips

- Right-click and element and select "Copy styles" to copy all of the CSS styles applied to an element.

## Notes

- Source Maps are used by the DevTools to map a pre-processed file to a file on disk, e.g., a TypeScript file. Source Maps can be accessed in the `Sources` tab of the DevTools.

## Troubleshooting

To exit responsive design mode, use `⌘⇧M`.
