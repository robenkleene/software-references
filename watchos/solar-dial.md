The Solar Dial consists of a 24-hour dial with 12 (noon) at the top and 24 (midnight) at the bottom. An hour hand moves once around the dial per day, and attached to the hour hand is miniature representation of the Sun.

- **Light Blue**: Day light hours
- **Dark Blue**: Night

The dots for sunset represent Civil Twilight, Nautical Twilight, and Astronomical Twilight, plus sunset itself.

Sunrise and sunset are defined as when the sun's disk appears above, or disappears below, the horizon.
