# OmniOutliner

## Outlining

The way to think about column editing in OmniOutliner, is that it's not cell based. You just move between cells like you're editing a line of text (e.g., use move by word commands).

- `↩`: Create a new row below
- `⇧↩`: Create a new row above
- `⎋`: Start editing current cell
- `⌘↩`: Start or end editing current cell (prefer this for editing because it works in both OmniFocus and OmniOutliner)

## Sorting

- `Organize > Keep Sorted`

## Columns

- You can't delete the default column (the one with the row handles). You also can't switch which column this is, or seemingly even cut and paste a column.

## Settings

- Just turn on `⇥` to move between cells and use `⌘[` / `⌘]` to indent or outdent the current row

## Themes

To update a theme, select `Format > Apply Template Theme`.
