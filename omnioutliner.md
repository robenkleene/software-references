# OmniOutliner Commands

The way to think about column editing in OmniOutliner, is that it's not cell based. You just move between cells like you're editing a line of text (e.g., use move by word commands).

- `⇧↩`: Create a new row above
- `⎋`: Start editing current cell
- `⌘↩`: End editing current cell
