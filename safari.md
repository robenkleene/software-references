## Trusting a Certificate

To trust a website certificate, for example when testing SSL on a website on a development server with a self-signed certificate, just visit the untrusted website via Safari's UI. After doing so, you'll have to enter your administrator password, and then the certificate will be added to your keychain and the trust settings can then be changed there.
