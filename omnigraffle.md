## Lists

- The bullet list options are with the rulers (`View > Rulers` or `⌘R`).

## Tool Shortcuts

Tapping the lettered tool shortcuts.

## Tips & Tricks

* **Easiest way to add connections**: Hold `C` for the line tool, this will show the magnets for the hovered shape, then drag to the magnet on another shape

## Snap

In order for `Snap to Grid` and `Align Objects to Grid` to work, the following conditions must be met:

* `⌥⌘[`: Align Objects to Grid

1. The minor grid spacing must be a subdivision of the major grid spacing
	* Minor spacing is the number of subdivisions
2. When moving an object, snap to grid will not actually align an object fully to the grid, because the objects size probably doesn't match the grid's size, and moving only changes an objects position not it's size. To resize an object, use `Align Objects to Grid` with it selected (`⌥⌘[`).

## Magnets

Magnets are used to snap lines to a specific position on a shape.

* **Showing Magnets**: `View -> Magnets`
* **Add a Magnet**: Use Magnet Tool (`m`) and click anywhere on object
* **Delete a Magnet**: `⇧-click` or `⌥-click` the magnet

A strategy:

* Just show magnets and drag the magnet to the right place on the shape
* Actually above doesn't work, really you want to just drag the magnet after selecting the magnet tool (m)

### Magnets & Snapping

Magnets do not support snapping to grid. But they do support snapping to the 1/4 size increments of the shape (look for the blue lines that show up when snapping).

## Style Brush

* `⌥-click`: Absorb a style (just clicking will do this if the style brush is empty)
* **Reset style brush**: Long click the icon, `Clear Contents`

## Grid

The grid settings are under "Canvas" in the right sidebar, some good settings are:

- **Major Grid Spacing**: `40px`
- **Minor Grid Steps**: `4px`
