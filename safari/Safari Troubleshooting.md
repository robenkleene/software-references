# Safari Troubleshooting

## Bookmarks

- To fix bookmarks syncing, turn `Settings > iCloud > Safari` off and on again.
    - You'll probably have to so it on all platforms.
    - iOS will ask you if you want to delete the bookmark data or not, but macOS will not, so it's probably safer to test everything by turning macOS off then back on again before doing the other platforms.
