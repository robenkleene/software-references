# Safari Troubleshooting

## Pages Not Loading

- Sometimes Safari won't load a web page and has a message `This webpage was reloaded because of a problem` then `a problem repeatedly occurred`. Disabling JavaScript should get the page to load, but to fix it you'll have to restart the computer.

## Bookmarks

- To fix bookmarks syncing, turn `Settings > iCloud > Safari` off and on again.
    - You'll probably have to so it on all platforms.
    - iOS will ask you if you want to delete the bookmark data or not, but macOS will not, so it's probably safer to test everything by turning macOS off then back on again before doing the other platforms.

## Slow Address Bar

This is related to history, setting `General > Remove history items: After two weeks` seems fine
