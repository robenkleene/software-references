# Safari

## Tabs

- To open a URL in an existing tab, rather than new window, just open a new tab and have it on the `Empty` page (the `Start` page doesn't work).

## Debug Tools

- To view resources by type, e.g., see all style sheets, go to the sources tab, then in the lower right, to the right of the filter, there's a dropdown menu to just choose a specific resource type.

## Notifications

The setting to disable sites asking for permission to send notifications is under "Preferences > Websites > Notifications > Allow websites to ask for permission to send notifications".

## Trusting a Certificate

To trust a website certificate, for example when testing SSL on a website on a development server with a self-signed certificate, just visit the untrusted website via Safari's UI. After doing so, you'll have to enter your administrator password, and then the certificate will be added to your keychain and the trust settings can then be changed there.

## Troubleshooting

URL bar input lag is caused by having too many items in your history, the fix is to only store one month, or shorter, history items.
