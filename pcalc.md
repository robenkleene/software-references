# PCalc

- Hitting `1++=` will output `2`, then hitting `=` will repeat the last calculation, incrementing the number again, so it can be used as a counter (this also works on Apple Watch)

## iOS

### Settings

- `Settings > Advanced > Repeat Operation on Equals`

## Apple Watch

The digital crown can be used to increment the current number, to use it as a counter.
