# OmniFocus vs. Reminders

Use OmniFocus for today list because:

- Reminders are unreliable to move
- OmniFocus scripting makes it easy to move all today items to tomorrow

Use Reminders for specific timed reminders because:

- Siri
- Fantastical can be configured to only show notifications for Reminders with a time (e.g., everything except all-day reminders) which is what I usually want
