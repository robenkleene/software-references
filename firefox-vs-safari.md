# Firefox vs. Safari

## Firefox

### Pros

- Firefox is faster

## Safari

### Pros

- In Google Docs on Safari, `âŒ˜-click` from the Documents page behaves sanely
- When opening a URL from another app, e.g., from browsing bookmarks in LaunchBar, Safari can have the new URL open in an existing window as a tab by setting opening a new `Empty` page in Safari
- Safari supports JavaScript, so Safari can for example open a list of URLs in Safari tabs
