# Apple Calculator

- Hitting `1+=` will output `2`, then hitting `=` will repeat the last calculation, incrementing the number again, so it can be used as a counter (this also works on Apple Watch)
- After `=` is setup to increment, hitting `1=` will reset to `1` then increment (i.e., the counter can be reset without having to hit `+`)
