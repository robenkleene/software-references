# OmniGraffle Screenshots

1. Create a new document and paste in the screenshot
2. Add text labels the look nice on top of the screenshot (you can avoid selecting the image itself by tapping `T`, the shortcut for the `Text Tool`, again)
3. With the text selected, in the `Properties` inspector (`âŒ˜2`), choose `Connections > Other Objects > 2 magnets: E, W`
4. Add invisible text boxes for each item you want to callout by drawing a rectangle with the `Shape Tool` (`S`), and then on the `Object` inspector, setting the `Fill` and `Stroke` to `No Fill` and `No Stroke`
