# OmniGraffle Text

## Tips

### Labels on Top of Objects

When hovering over an object, you can add a new text label on top of an object, instead of to the object itself, just by tapping `T` again.

The specific behavior is that selecting the text tool, and then moving the mouse, will select any objects hovered over. This trick works because after triggering the text tool, and before the mouse is moved, no object is selected.
