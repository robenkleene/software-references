# Final Cut Pro Quick Start

1. By default, Final Cut will create a new Library (`Untitled.fcpbundle` in `~/Movies`), if it can't find the previous library. Rename the library after your project.
2. Before archiving a `fcpbundle`, select the library in the sidebar, then choose `File > Delete Generated Library Files...` and delete everything (be sure to select `Delete Render Files: All`). (Note that this menu item is contextually aware, so be sure the library is selected in the sidebar and not a project for example.)
