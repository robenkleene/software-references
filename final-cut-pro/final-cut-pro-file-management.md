# Final Cut Pro File Management

## Startup

1. On startup, if it can't find the previous library, Final Cut will prompt you to choose an existing `fcpbundle` or create a new one (`Untitled.fcpbundle` in `~/Movies`). Rename the library after your project.
2. Before archiving a `fcpbundle`, select the library in the sidebar, then choose `File > Delete Generated Library Files...` and delete everything (be sure to select `Delete Render Files: All`). (Note that this menu item is contextually aware, so be sure the library is selected in the sidebar and not a project for example.)

## Libraries

- To close a library in the sidebar, choose `File > Close Library`
