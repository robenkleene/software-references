- `\`: This toggles off note entry, it's unclear if there's also a corresponding keyboard shortcut to turn it back on
- The MIDI settings are at the far left of the on screen keyboard, there's an info icon that isn't visible in Dark Mode.
- To enter notes from the on screen keyboard, make sure the Quarter Note is visible, if it's not, first click the note/rest icon above the keyboard, that should make a quarter note visible, then click the note to toggle it on.
