# Excel Notes

Excel has two concepts: notes and comments. Comments are generally for communication, and notes for information.

- You can add a note or a comment under "Review".
- You can hide or show notes under "Review > Notes".
- `Edit > Clear > Clear Comments and Notes`: Clear notes
- `⇧F2`: Edit note or comment

(`⇧F10` to open the right-click menu is useful for accessing more notes functions.)
