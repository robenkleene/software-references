# Excel Tables

- Select a range and "Home" -> "Format as Table" (`⌘T`)
- With any cell in the table selected, "Table" -> "Total Row"
- Add a total row by going to "Table" in the Ribbon, and clicking the "Total Row" checkbox (it's only visible when a cell in the table is selected)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `⇥`: Create a new row when the last cell in the table is selected

### Adding a Header

The best way to add a header to an Excel table is to "Merge & Center" a cell above the table under "Home > Merge & Center", to the right of the alignment controls (if the window size is too small, it will only be under an icon). Then just type the name of the table in again.

## Total Row

To add a "Total Row" (to sum columns for example), select "Table" and check "Total Row", you can choose the type of the cell (e.g., "Sum") by clicking a cell and selecting from the drop-down menu.
