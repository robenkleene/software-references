# Excel Formatting

- To clear formatting, use "Edit" -> "Clear" -> "Formats", but this will delete things like hyperlink styles
- A more precise way to clear formatting is to open cell styles `⌘1` and select "Font" -> "Normal Font"
- To clear borders, in the toolbar, choose "Home > (Border Icon) > No Borders"

## Data

- `⇧⌃$`: Format cell as currency
