## Excel Style

## Cell Styles

Excel has some useful built-in styles under "Home" -> "Cell Styles".

- Normal
- Good
- Bad
- Neutral
- Input: Something meant to be changed
- Calculation: Something that is output

## Percent

- Excel uses decimals values `1>` as percents, e.g., `0.5` is `5%`
    - If you have cells that are not decimals, e.g., `5` for `5%`, the easiest way to convert the cells is to put `100` in a cell, copy it, and select the cells to divide and hit `⌃⌘V` for `Paste Special...`, and choose `Divide`.
