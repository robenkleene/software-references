# Excel Charts

## Adding a Chart

1. Select the data
2. Go to "Insert" in the ribbon
3. Click the type of chart you'd like to add

## Axes

### Axis Date

To change the axis, right-click the chart and select "Select Data...", then delete the existing entry in "Horizontal (Category) axis labels" and highlight the cells in the spreadsheet.

### Axis Formatting

Right-click the axis and select "Format Axis..." (or click the axis, and select "Axis Options" in the sidebar), this has options like setting the minimum, maximum, and increment. As well as for type formatting like dates.

## Vector

- Charts can be copied and pasted to Photoshop as Vector Smart Objects that can be resized.

## Design

Select the chart then choose `Chart Design` in the ribbon to:

- Try different themes
- `Change Colors`
- Choose a `Quick Layout`
- `Add Chart Element`, like an axis
- Choosing one of the templates allows you to show the number for each point in a line chart

## Ignoring Data

- `#N/A` is ignored by graphs. You can use the `NA()` function, that returns `#N/A` to selectively ignore data.

## Tips

- There's no way to swap the X and Y axes automatically, there is a "Switch Row/Column" button under "Chart Design", but that does something different. To swap the axes, cut and paste between the two "Y values" and "Horizontal (Category) axis labels".

## Customizing a Chart

1. Right-click and choose `Select Data...`
2. For `Chart data range`, select the entire table
3. For `Name`, select one table header that will be used in the key
4. For `Y values`, select the column to be used as the Y values, excluding the header
