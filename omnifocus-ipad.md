# OmniFocus iPad

Adding a new project: 

* If a single project is selected in the sidebar, then the add button will have a circle around it, this circle means that the add will be specific to that project.
* If no project is selected, and the detail view is showing a aggregate of all the projects at the current level, then the add button will not have a circle around it, and it will give the option to add a project or folder.
* If a project is selected, the only way to return to the project aggregate view, is to tap the back button and then a folder again.
