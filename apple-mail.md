# Apple Mail

## Remote Images

- Remote images aren't downloaded if `Mail > Privacy > Protect Mail Activity` is turned on

## Exchange

If an email that was moved is stuck in the `Inbox`, use `Mailbox > Rebuild` then try moving it again.

If that doesn't work, you'll have to delete and re-add the account.
