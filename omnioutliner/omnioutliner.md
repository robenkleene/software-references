# OmniOutliner

- `⌘-click` a row to select it (e.g., this avoids toggling a checkbox or a disclosure indicator, or starting to edit a row)

## Notes

- `⌘'`: Toggle note
- `⌃⌘'`: Toggle all notes

## Outlining

The way to think about column editing in OmniOutliner, is that it's not cell based. You just move between cells like you're editing a line of text (e.g., use move by word commands).

- `↩`: Create a new row below (by default, this creates a new sibling if the current item has no children, and a child if it does have children, this can be changed with `Preferences > Keyboard > New rows are created: Always at the same level`)
- `⇧↩`: Create a new row above
- `⎋`: Start editing current cell
- `⌘↩`: Start or end editing current cell (prefer this for editing because it works in both OmniFocus and OmniOutliner)
- `⇧⌘{`: New sibling to parent
- `⇧⌘}`: New child

## Sorting

- `Organize > Keep Sorted`

## Columns

- You can't delete the default column (the one with the row handles). You also can't switch which column this is, or seemingly even cut and paste a column.
- The type of a column (`Date`, `Checkbox`, `Rich Text`, `Number`, `Duration`, `Pop-Up List`), can be set in the `Inspector > Selection Style > Column Type > Type`

## Settings

- Just turn on `⇥` to move between cells and use `⌘[` / `⌘]` to indent or outdent the current row

## Themes

To update a theme, select `Format > Apply Template Theme`.
